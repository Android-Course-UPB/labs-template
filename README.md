Welcome to the Android Course.

The lab template contains the "main" branch with an initial commit. Here are the steps to create a new Pull Request (PR) with your assignment.

1. Create a new branch (e.g. "lab3")

# git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME

2. Add your new code in a new commit

# git add NEW_FILES
# git commit

3. Push the new commit to your repository

# git push origin NEW_BRANCH_NAME

4. A link to a new PR will be printed on the console, or you can directly access the Github page

Create a PR from the new branch to the main branch.
